### Project Descriptions

⏩ The car damage detection project is an advanced system designed to automatically identify and assess vehicular damages using computer vision and machine learning techniques. <br>

⏩ In Phase 1 we developed a Machine learning model is an innovative application that leverages Flask, a Python web framework, to detect and assess vehicular damages. This project utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze uploaded images of cars, swiftly identifying and highlighting areas of potential damage. The project contributes to faster and more accurate damage assessment, leading to improved decision-making, reduced processing time, and enhanced customer satisfaction. <br>

⏩ The output of Phase 1 is a web application that detects damaged car parts with high accuracy. The application takes an image of a car as input and outputs the following:

- Detection of damaged parts (e.g., bumper, fender, windshield, etc.)
- Accuracy metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) indicating the model's performance.

The Phase 1 output provides a solid foundation for the next phase of the project, which will focus on assessing the severity of damage and estimating repair costs.
