### Project Descriptions

⏩ Building on the success of Phase 1, which developed a web application for damaged car part detection, Phase 2 aimed to enhance the system's performance and functionality. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, we integrated additional models to enhance damage detection capabilities and optimized the algorithm for faster processing and improved performance, leading to a significant increase in accuracy and efficiency. This enhanced system generates QR codes that provide instant access to detailed repair information, including defect analysis, suggested repairs, and estimated costs, enabling informed decision-making and streamlined repair processes. <br>

⏩ "Smart Detection of Car defective parts with Recommendations" is an innovative application that leverages Flask, a Python web framework, to detect and assess vehicular damages. This project utilizes advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze uploaded images of cars, swiftly identifying and highlighting areas of potential damage. <br>

⏩ The output of Phase 2 is a web application that detects damaged car parts with high accuracy. The application takes an image of a car as input and outputs the following:

- a web application with improved damage detection capabilities.
- QR code generation for easy access to repair information and detailed reports on damage assessment and repair recommendations.
- Accuracy metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) indicating the model's performance
- providing a comprehensive solution for damaged car assessment and repair management.
